This docker image is intended to be used as a proxy in front of a WordPress
site, to avoid needing to run `wp search-replace`, which on larger sites or
networked sites can take an inordinate amount of time.

This proxy is intended for use with [Tugboat QA](https://www.tugboat.qa), but
should be usable in other Docker tools, such as Docker Compose, Lando, etc.

This probably goes without saying but this image isâ€¦

**ðŸ’€ NOT for use in a production environment. ðŸ’€**

## Usage

1. Create a yaml file that contains the map of sites you'd like to proxy.
```yaml
backend_uri: http://php
sites:
  # Simple key / val syntax assumes the scheme and proxy scheme are https.
  www.misterrogers.com: misterrogers.tugboat.qa
  # You can declare everything as well.
  kingfriday.com:
    scheme: http
    # Without setting this explicitly, kingfriday.com would have been used.
    host: www.kingfriday.com
    proxy_host: kingfriday-${TUGBOAT_DEFAULT_SERVICE_TOKEN}.tugboat.qa
    proxy_scheme: http
    # You can also override the top level backend_uri for a single site.
    backend_uri: http://nginx
```

- `backend_uri`: The proxied service that is serving the wordpress site.
- `sites`: A keyed list of sites. The key will be used as the `host` unless it is explicitly set below.
- `host`: The production host that is stored in the database, e.g. `www.example.com`.
- `scheme`: The http scheme of the real site, i.e. `https` or `http`. Defaults to `https`.
- `proxy_host`: The host that is stored in the database, e.g. `www.example.com`.
- `proxy_scheme`: The http scheme of the proxied site, i.e. `https` or `http`. Defaults to `https`.

2. Save this file in your repo at `.tugboat/wp-proxy.yml` or define a custom environment variable with the path to the file:

`WP_PROXY_MAP_FILE=path/to/map.yml`

When the container starts, Apache will start and read in that file and set up the necessary vhosts.
